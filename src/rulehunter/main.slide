* Rulehunter

Rulehunter is a software application that analyses historic data

Provides recommendations to achieve your goals, such as to improve ROI

Balances competing priorities, such as a company's ROI vs its client's ROI

* An Example to Set the Scene

* A Call Center Working on Behalf of its Client

.html css.html
A call centre's client wants them to sell printer repair contracts

The call centre and the client have competing priorities

*The*client’s*requirements*

- The ROI (Return On Investment) must be at least 15.0
- At least 25% of contacts must result in a repair contract
- They would like the total value of contracts to be as high as possible

*The*call*centre’s*requirements*

- The ROI for the call centre needs to be at least 1.10
- The clients requirements must be met
- Once the client's requirements are met the call centre would like an ROI of 1.30

: The call centre ROI has factored in the cost of the telephone calls, the callers' pay and additional overheads.

* What Can the Call Centre do to Balance These Priorities?

The companies to call are split into segments

*The*call*centre*can*adjust*the*following:*

- Who calls which segment
- Who calls each quarter
- Which quarter in the day each segment is called
- How many callbacks are allowed by each caller
- _How_many_callbacks_are_attempted_for_each_segment_


* Use of Rulehunter

The campaign needs to be called for a while to create a dataset

The requirements of the call centre and its client are given to Rulehunter

The fields that can be used in the rule are also specified

Rulehunter regularly and automatically processes the most up-to-date dataset


* A Dataset

* How Many Callbacks for Each Segment?

The data set contains 5000 records, each representing a lead

.html how_many_callbacks_segment_dataset.html


* An Experiment

* Creating an Experiment

Rulehunter uses files called _experiments_ to specify the user's needs

You tell it which fields from the dataset you would like it to be able to use in the rules:

  ruleGeneration:
    fields:
      - callbacks
      - segment


* Creating an Experiment - Variables

An _experiment_ file contains variables that should be calculated

  - name: "Total Call Centre Cost"
    kind: "sum"
    # £0.04/min call cost, plus £10/hr caller cost, plus £10/hr overheads
    # Equal: (0.04/60) + (10/60/60) + (10/60/60) = £0.0062/second
    arg: "callTime * 0.0062"

  - name: "Total Client Commission"
    kind: "calc"
    # 5% commission on the value of all repair contracts
    arg: "value * 0.05"

  - name: "Conversion"
    kind: "calc"
    arg: "numSignups / totalContacts"

* Creating an Experiment - Goals and Priorities

Goals and priorities can be specified

  goals:
    - "Total Call Centre ROI >= 1.10"
    - "Total Client ROI >= 15"
    - "Conversion > 0.25"
    - "Total Call Centre ROI >= 1.30"

  sortOrder:
    - aggregator: "Total Client Value"
      direction: "descending"



* A Report


* How Many Callbacks for Each Segment? - The Best Rule

Rulehunter finds the following rule:

  (in(segment,"a","d","f","g") && callbacks <= 5) ||
  (in(segment,"b","c","e") && callbacks <= 9)

*Human*Explanation*

Segments: _a_, _d_, _f_ and _g_ should have a maximum of _5_ callbacks
Segments: _b_, _c_ and _e_ should have a maximum of _9_ callbacks

* How Many Callbacks for Each Segment? - The Result (Aggregators)

The report shows the difference between the use of the rule and without

.html how_many_callbacks_segment_aggregators.html

* How Many Callbacks for Each Segment? - The Result (Goals)

With the rule the report shows that all the goals are met, without none are met

.html how_many_callbacks_segment_goals.html


* How Many Callbacks for Each Segment? - Analysis

All the specified goals are met when the rule is used

The call centre has gone from making a loss of £-11,059 to making a profit of £2,062
